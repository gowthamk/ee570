This paper is a review of three papers from recent artificial intelligence
research literature that are connected by the common theme of knowledge
representation. The first paper \cite{minsat} defines the problem of minimum
satisfiability (MinSAT) for propositional logic and constructs an algorithm
based on informed bounded search of state space. Second paper \cite{qbf}
attempts to construct an efficient decision procedure for quantified boolean
formulas by alternating between search and clause resolution. The last paper
\cite{nlp} is an interesting application of logics based on first-order logic to
compress English sentences. For evaluation we implemented the MinSatz algorithm
described in first paper utilizing the rewrite system from
\cite{siskind-rewrite}. While we found few inconsistencies in the algorithm as
it was described in the paper, our emperical results conclude that MinSatz is
efficient when compared to straightforward extensions of DPLL for MinSAT
problem.
